### Что такое Whitepaper, зачем она нужна и как работает?

A white paper is a document that argues a specific position or solves a problem for its audience. They first originated as a type of official government document.Typically, the purpose of a white paper is to advocate that a certain position is the best way to go or that a certain solution is best for a particular problem. When it is used for commercial purposes, it could influence the decision-making processes of current and prospective customers. 78% of buyers used white papers in the past 12 months to research B2B purchasing decisions.

**What exactly is a white paper?**

Ask any 10 people this question, and you’ll likely get 12 different answers. Here is the best short definition I’ve ever found, after years of looking: **A white paper is a persuasive essay that uses facts and logic to promote a certain product, service, or viewpoint.**

**Are there any industry standards for these documents?**

In a word, no. Anyone can call anything a white paper. And they do. Today’s “typical” white paper is 6 to 8 pages long, shorter than in past years. But I’ve seen everything from a two-page flyer to a 100-page book called a “white paper.” The typical white paper looks better than a technical manual, but not as slick as a brochure or ad. But some white papers are as colorful as a cereal box. The typical white paper is distributed as a PDF on the web. But some are still printed out for sales calls, press kits and trade shows.

**If there’s no standards, aren’t there at least some conventions? Well, perhaps.**

White paper experts including Gordon Graham have identified these key characteristics for a white paper:

A document containing narrative text
* At least 5-6 pages long
* Oriented in portrait format (landscape format tends to be for B2B e-books)
* Educational, practical and useful, not a sales pitch
* Used before a sale, not after a sale
* Provides facts, not just opinion
* Includes an introduction or executive summary

If a document has all these characteristics, it’s probably a white paper.

**White papers and case studies: What’s the difference?**

White papers sometimes mention case studies for evidence of a vendor’s claims. But the two are quite different in form and content. Case studies are extended testimonials on how a product or service helped someone in the real world. They are typically between 500 and 1,500 words long, written in a journalistic style with many quotes from the actual customer.

The classic format for a case study is Before/After, Then/Now, Problem/Solution: Before we had this terrible problem, then we found this fantastic product, and After we started using it, everything was sweetness and light.

White papers, on the other hand, are persuasive essays about a certain product, service, technology or methodology.

They are generally 2,500 words or more, written in a somewhat academic style, with no direct quotes from the vendor’s representatives. A white paper may be told in the Problem/Solution format, but rarely in the Before/After format. White papers tend to be used earlier in the sales cycle, to help prospects visualize a possible solution to a nagging problem.

Case studies tend to be used later in the sales cycle to reassure a prospect that other buyers benefited from the same approach they are considering.
